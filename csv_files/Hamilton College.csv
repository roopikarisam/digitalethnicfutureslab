"This morning the United States Supreme Court ruled that the race-conscious admission programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina are unconstitutional, reversing over 40 years of precedent and forcing many colleges and universities across the country to revamp their admission processes. Our Admission Office has long been preparing for this outcome, and we are working with outside counsel and our New York Six partner institutions to study the decision and determine the best course of action. We will do everything we can within the law to ensure that Hamilton College remains a diverse and inclusive living and learning community. This is an issue of the utmost importance to the College, to higher education, to society, and to me, personally and professionally. Last year, Hamilton joined 32 other liberal arts colleges in filing an amicus brief with the Court that stressed “the educational benefits of a diverse student body and the societal benefits of educating diverse future leaders.” I have written about the history and importance of affirmative action in the Washington Post and The Hill and spoken about it often. Since our founding in 1793 as the Hamilton-Oneida Academy, we have worked to bring people from different backgrounds together to live and learn on College Hill. Our mission, to prepare students for lives of meaning, purpose, and active citizenship, demands that we pursue all lawful means to preserve the benefits a diverse and inclusive community affords."
