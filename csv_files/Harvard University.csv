"Dear Members of the Harvard Community,
Today, the Supreme Court delivered its decision in Students for Fair Admissions v.
President and Fellows of Harvard College. The Court held that Harvard College's
admissions system does not comply with the principles of the equal protection clause
embodied in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The Court also ruled that colleges and
universities may consider in admissions decisions “an applicant's discussion of how
race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise.” We
will certainly comply with the Court's decision.
We write today to reaffirm the fundamental principle that deep and transformative
teaching, learning, and research depend upon a community comprising people of
many backgrounds, perspectives, and lived experiences. That principle is as true and important today as it was yesterday. So too are the abiding values that have enabled
us—and every great educational institution—to pursue the high callingof educating
creative thinkers and bold leaders, of deepening human knowledge, andof promoting
progress, justice, and human flourishing.
We affirm that:
« Because the teaching, learning, research, and creativity that bring progress
and change require debate and disagreement, diversity and difference are
essential to academic excellence. « To prepare leaders for a complex world, Harvard must admit and educate a
student body whose members reflect, and have lived, multiple facets of
human experience. No part of what makes us who we are could ever be
irrelevant. + Harvard must always be a place of opportunity, a place whose doors remain
open to those to whom they had long been closed, a place where many will
have the chance to live dreams their parentsor grandparents could not have
dreamed.
For almost a decade, Harvard has vigorously defended an admissions system that, as
two federal courts ruled, fully complied with longstanding precedent. In the weeks and
months ahead, drawing on the talent and expertise of our Harvard community, we will
determine how to preserve, consistent with the Court's new precedent, our essential
values.
The heart of our extraordinary institution is its people. Harvard will continue to be a
vibrant community whose members come from all walks of life, all over the world. To
our students, faculty, staff, researchers, and alumni—past, present, and future—who
call Harvard your home, please know that you are, and always will be, Harvard. Your
remarkable contributions to our community and the world drive Harvard's distinction.
Nothing today has changed that."
