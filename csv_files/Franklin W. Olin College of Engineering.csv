"As the current session of the United States Supreme Court winds down, the justices are expected to decide on two cases challenging affirmative action policies in admissions at the University of North Carolina and Harvard University.

The impending decision, expected later this spring, is expected to have far-reaching consequences for admissions practices in higher education across the country.

At Olin, embedded in our founding precepts, is the call to “develop as diverse a student community as is possible.” 

And last year, we unveiled a strategic plan grounded in the vision “Engineering for Everyone.” Our vision for the future includes the guiding principles that engineering education needs to be open to everyone and engineering as a profession must servee veryone.

As stated in our strategic plan and experienced daily at Olin, research shows that diverse teams are more effective than nondiverse teams. Maintaining and expanding a diverse Olin community is critical for developing students’ understanding and appreciation of perspectives other than their own. There is also evidence that educational experiences that are more directly connected to making the world a better place are more attractive, welcoming, and inclusive for students from diverse backgrounds.

The Office of the President and the Office of Admission and Financial Aid (OAFA) are watching this decision closely. We are analyzing Olin’s approach to admissions outreach to ensure that we are ready to meet whatever changes or challenges lie ahead.

This year, Olin has admitted students from 35 states and 14 countries. Many are among the first generation in their family to attend college, and many are students of color. We are proud that in this most recent admitted class, 59% are domestic students of color and 27% are domestic Black, Latinx, Native American, or Pacific Islander.  

This shift in the makeup of our incoming classes is no accident.

Over the past few years, Olin has initiated programs for students and for employees designed to foster an inclusive climate and encourage a sense of belonging. The Office of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access “exists to minimize the barriers and exclusion historically present on college and engineering campuses.” OAFA works with students to sponsor a fly-in program for prospective students who otherwise would not have the resources to visit campus.

The benefits of diversity are not limited to the student experience alone. At Olin, we are working to make diversity and inclusion part of our organizational culture. This year, the DEI Champions convened their first cohort, 13 Olin employees. The group is working to bring the tenets of racial equity work to three key areas: the student experience, the employee experience, and data. Olin has also signed on to the SEA Change Initiative with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which aims to advance institutional transformation in support of DEI. 

As we look ahead to the final judicial decision, we want the Olin community to know that we will not waiver from our founding principles or our vision. Simply put, we value equity. We value inclusion. We value diversity. We will continue to be a strong and vital institution if we live by these values.

Warmly,  

Gilda Barabino, President 

Emily Roper-Doten, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid"
