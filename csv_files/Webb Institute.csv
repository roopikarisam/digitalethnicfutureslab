"To the Webb community,

On June 29, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision on how colleges and universities may consider race in their admissions policies and practices.  

The National Association of College Admissions Counseling (NACAC) has created an admissions/legal team to analyze the 237-page opinion and provide guidance in the coming weeks and months on compliance with the ruling.  We will review our own policies and practices to ensure we are fully compliant.  

Webb remains committed to an admission process that is merit-based and inclusive.  We seek diversity amongst applicants who meet our high academic standards.  The best and brightest applicants come from a diverse applicant pool.  Webb has and continues to work to increase representation of all qualified individuals in its student body and is a far better place for it.  

Our graduates enter industries that compete globally; navigating cultural differences is a vital skill, best developed in a diverse student body.  The maritime industry continues to diversify, and we will support that transition.  Our founder, William H. Webb, was a firm believer in the power of accessible education; we increasingly attract applicants who are first-generation college students, from a variety of backgrounds, hailing from families of limited means. 

As we continue to explore this ongoing discussion, please do not hesitate to reach out to me and let us keep an open dialogue on how best to achieve our goals. 

Regards,

Mark Martecchini

President"
