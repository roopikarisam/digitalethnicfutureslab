"Dear Wake Forest Community,

Today, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion in two cases concerning the use of race as a factor in higher education admissions. The Court ruled that race-conscious admission programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill were unlawful.

We write to affirm that Wake Forest University will not waver in its commitment to creating and sustaining inclusive, diverse learning communities; our mission and values have not and will not change. We will continue to recruit and enroll academically qualified students of diverse backgrounds who seek an intellectual home at Wake Forest where they belong and thrive, and in compliance with the Court’s ruling. 

The admissions teams in our College, graduate programs and professional schools have been preparing for this moment. At our direction, these teams have examined a range of potential outcomes for the Court’s opinion with support from experts in the legal field over the past year. We will study the ruling to fully understand its implications, and adapt our practices as needed to be in compliance; and we will do so in a manner that upholds our commitment to our mission and our values. 

As an institution rooted in our motto, Pro Humanitate, our commitment to our University community has never been stronger. Bringing together students, faculty and staff from diverse backgrounds, lived experiences and perspectives strengthens our learning environment, encourages us to evaluate and engage with diverse points of view, and contributes meaningfully to our students’ intellectual and personal development. By living out this commitment, we will ensure Wake Forest continues to be a vibrant intellectual community for all who live, learn and work across our institution.

Sincerely,

Susan R. Wente, President

Michele Gillespie, Provost
