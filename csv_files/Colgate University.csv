"Today, the U.S. Supreme Court released its opinion in connection with two cases that challenged the permissibility of race-conscious admissions practices at both public and private universities and colleges. Colgate, in collaboration with legal counsel, is now carefully reviewing the opinion and its potential implications, and is working to determine the best course of action to continue recruitment of diverse and academically talented students to the University. As we carefully review this decision and its implications, and as we look ahead to future admission cycles, we will continue to be dedicated to doing everything possible within the confines of the law to recruit the most talented students from all backgrounds to attend Colgate. As part of our longstanding efforts to attract such students, Colgate has adopted a number of steps in its admissions and financial aid practices in recent years. First, Colgate moved toward a more holistic application review process in 2020. Further, in 2021, the University launched the Colgate Commitment, which provides new levels of financial support for Colgate students. These steps have enabled Colgate to enroll remarkably talented and diverse classes over the last several years as the number of applications to the University has more than doubled. We are very proud of these steps. They have served Colgate well, as they support our mission and core academic purpose. In the weeks and months ahead, Colgate will carefully and systematically review our practices and policies to determine our next steps in service of the values and mission of the University. We will keep the campus and wider University community informed as we go through this process."
