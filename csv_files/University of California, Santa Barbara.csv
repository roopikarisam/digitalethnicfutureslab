"I am writing to share an important message from President Drake regarding today's decision by the Supreme Court regarding the use of race in college admissions. Despite the ruling, our commitment to the goals of equity and access remains.
I want to echo President Drake's sentiments that student diversity is a top priority for our campus and for the University of California. Our campus is committed to advancing our mission of diversity and excellence, and providing access and opportunity.
We will continue to work together to provide the broadest possible student access to an affordable, high-quality UC education, and to support a diverse learning, living, and working environment where all members of our campus community can thrive."
