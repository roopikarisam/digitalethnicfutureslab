"When I walk around campus or look out at the freshmen at Matriculation in September or our graduates on Nickerson Field, I can see the diversity of our community. We have been intentional in building an academic community based on inclusive excellence, and I believe the result is a model for the country. The ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS)—in cases addressing the admissions practices at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina—is profoundly disappointing because it takes us backward, potentially creating less diverse college campuses and a less just America. This decision is antithetical to Boston University’s values and mission. The ruling limits powerful tools that universities have used to promote access and diversity. We are reviewing the decision to better understand what it means for our admissions and academic practices and the changes we may be required to make. That process will take some time. In the meantime, we do know there are things that will not change. Boston University is committed to inclusive excellence, built on a diverse student body. To the extent permitted by law, we will sustain this commitment by: Working to attract a student body that is racially and ethnically diverse. We will continue to recruit students from underrepresented communities and encourage them to apply and attend Boston University. Evaluating student applications by considering the totality of an individual’s background and experience and potential for success at Boston University, with a continued commitment to inclusive excellence. Maintaining those financial aid policies that open our doors to economically disadvantaged students and have made our undergraduate student body the most diverse in the institution’s history. Maintaining those programs that support students from diverse and economically disadvantaged backgrounds and foster a sense of belonging in our community. Our obligation is to be an academic community devoted to inclusive excellence in everything we do and to ensure that our community is welcoming, inclusive, and accessible so that it can be a shining example for how our society can move forward in making our ideals realities."
