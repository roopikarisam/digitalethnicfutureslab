"As many of you will have seen by now, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued its decision in two cases related to race-conscious admissions: Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina. I want to assure each of you that, as we comply with the law, we remain deeply committed to a culture of belonging where all are valued and have the opportunity to add value. We have been preparing for any outcome in this case and will continue to offer exceptional educational opportunities based on studentsâ€™ individual accomplishments and life experiences, as well as our commitment to the fundamental principle that access to higher education should remain a driver of opportunity and social mobility. The excellence we strive for at the University of Miami has long relied on the talent and diversity of an inclusive community of scholars that is home to more than 19,000 students from around the world. In fact, nationally underrepresented minorities comprise nearly 60% of our student body. Since its pioneering efforts to desegregate admissions in the 1960s, the University of Miami has made meaningful and sustained progress in demonstrating that excellence and equity are two mutually reinforcing values. I have no doubt that we will continue to do so by attracting an outstanding community of students, faculty, and staff members driven by those values to better serve society. We are one U."
