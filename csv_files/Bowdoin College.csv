"To the Bowdoin community, 

The US Supreme Court handed down its opinion this morning in Students for Fair Admissions v. President & Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina—the two cases concerning race-conscious admissions policies. 

The opinion is quite lengthy, and it will take some time to fully understand its ramifications. Even so, it is clear and deeply disappointing that the court overturned more than forty years of precedent that has enhanced diversity in campus communities. President-elect Safa Zaki and I have discussed these cases, and we share the view that today’s decision undermines the essential work to create an educational environment and experience that prepares students for the diverse worlds of work and of informed political and social engagement. We also believe the decision undermines the long-term effort to recognize and respond to the structural obstacles for those in our society who have faced the most profound barriers to opportunity. 

The College will, of course, review the court’s opinion with great care and comply with its mandates. At the same time, and as I wrote to you last August, “whatever the outcome and no matter how challenging the work, we will never back away from our commitment to build and sustain a truly diverse community where everyone has the opportunity for an equitable experience and an enduring sense of belonging.” "
