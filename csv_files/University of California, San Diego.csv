"Today, the Supreme Court issued a complex ruling regarding the use of race in admissions, potentially ending the consideration of race or ethnicity in admissions decisions nationwide. I applaud University of California President Drake’s statement and share his disappointment with today’s ruling.

We recognize this ruling may cause concern for many in our community. We want to reiterate our steadfast commitment to cultivating a diverse and inclusive campus in which all members feel a sense of belonging and are able to thrive. We will be examining and working to mitigate any impact today’s decision may have on our campus.

California’s Proposition 209 has prohibited the consideration of race and gender in public college admissions since 1996. Despite this, we and our fellow UC campuses have carefully and thoughtfully sought effective ways to consider race-neutral alternatives in assessing the individual context of each of our applicants. For our campus, this has resulted in a significant increase in the diversity of our student body over the last decade. We firmly believe that access to quality education contributes significantly to economic mobility and enhances career trajectories, thus transforming the lives of our students and their families. 

UC San Diego remains committed to welcoming students from all backgrounds, celebrating diversity in all its manifestations and ensuring affordability and equitable access to a world-class education. We will continue to utilize every tool available to welcome qualified students into our diverse and dynamic academic community. Equity, diversity and inclusion remain embedded in our mission and core values and will always be top priorities for UC San Diego.

Pradeep K. Khosla
Chancellor"
