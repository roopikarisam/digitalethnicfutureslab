"Today's decision by the Supreme Court prohibiting holistic, race-conscious admissions practices is very disappointing. USC has long understood that excellence and diversity are inextricably intertwined. We educate innovative, thoughtful students from across the globe, who become leaders in every field. Each of our students' faculty and staff has earned a place here and contributes to creating one of the most stimulating and creative educational communities in the world. This decision will not impact our commitment to creating a campus that is welcoming, diverse, and inclusive to talented individuals from every background. USC provides an outstanding learning community where differing backgrounds and points of view are embraced, where ideas collide, beliefs are challenged and innovation thrives. We will not go backward. "
