"In light of today’s Supreme Court decision, Villanova, like all colleges and universities across the country, will carefully review the details of the ruling and determine how it may specifically impact our admissions processes and programs.
 
As an Augustinian Catholic institution, built upon the values of Unitas, Veritas and Caritas, we recognize the unique gifts and talents that each individual brings to our community, and that remains unchanged by today’s decision. We will continue to employ a holistic approach to decision-making that considers a variety of factors, including academic and extracurricular achievements, as well as other factors related to student background and experiences.
 
Since 1842, the Villanova community has been enriched and strengthened by individuals of diverse backgrounds, experiences and beliefs, and we will stay true to that foundation—now and in the future."
