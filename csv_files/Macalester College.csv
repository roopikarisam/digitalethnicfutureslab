"While the Supreme Court’s decision to restrict the consideration of race and ethnicity in college admissions is not surprising, it is very disappointing. A diverse student body creates a rich learning environment that prepares all students for success in a diverse workforce, and is critical for an innovative economy and a healthy democracy. In addition, a college degree is the single-most powerful driver of economic mobility for lower-income students, who disproportionately are members of groups that are underrepresented in higher education. 

At Macalester, assembling a diverse student body will remain a top priority and, though we are concerned about the effects of today’s ruling, we are prepared to do everything possible to ensure that the opportunity of a Macalester education remains accessible to everyone"
