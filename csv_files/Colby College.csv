"Earlier today the U.S. Supreme Court issued its ruling on cases involving the use of race in admissions at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. For decades the court has held that it is permissible to use race as one factor among many in admissions decisions. The court has now overturned that precedent in a decision that is likely to have a significant impact on America’s most selective colleges and universities, including Colby. I encourage you to read the ruling if you have not already.

Colby helped author an amicus brief filed in the Harvard case. In that brief, we, along with other leading colleges, argued that diversity is a compelling interest to our institutions and to the nation at large. To me, the argument for our institutional interest is straightforward: our mission is education and scholarship, which is greatly enriched in a diverse community of learners and scholars. Deep learning and groundbreaking discoveries are fostered through rigorous processes that consider a wide range of perspectives. In contrast, homogeneity of thought and experience can lead to groupthink and ultimately censor ideas and viewpoints that reveal truths and understanding. This is also the driving force behind the College’s strong stance on freedom of expression and inquiry. Diversity of experience and thought strengthen our mission.

There is no doubt that our perspectives—and the questions we ask, the assumptions we make—reflect our experiences. Those experiences are shaped by many things, with race certainly among them. Geography and culture also matter, which is why we seek geographic diversity in both the U.S. and abroad, why we have recently joined a consortium aimed at outreach and support to students from rural backgrounds, and why we have special financial aid programs designed to enroll students from low-income and middle-income families.

Colby’s excellence is directly tied to its commitment to diversity and to creating an equitable and inclusive environment for all. These are enduring values for us that will not be diminished by today’s decision. In fact, if you look at recent history you will see that the number of U.S. students of color has more than doubled at Colby. Over this same period, the academic qualifications of our incoming students have risen at an extraordinary rate. Colby has become one of the most selective and sought-after colleges in the country with students whose talents and achievements rank among the very best in the world. This simply would not have been possible without fortifying our commitment to access and enrolling classes that are increasingly diverse along many dimensions.

We are reviewing the details of the court’s decision now and will be focusing on how, within the new legal framework, we can continue to build excellence through diversity. That obligation is front and center for me personally and will not waver at Colby. Carrying out our mission requires nothing less."
