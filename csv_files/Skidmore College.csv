"Dear Skidmore Community,

Earlier today, the Supreme Court handed down a decision striking down Harvard University's and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s race-conscious admission policies as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Skidmore is currently consulting with our legal counsel and examining the 237-page ruling and the justices’ opinions, both those in the majority and those dissenting. We will share further information when the full impact and implications of this decision on Skidmore’s admissions practices are more fully understood. We will, of course, comply with any legal requirements this decision sets forth. The New York Six Liberal Arts Consortium, of which Skidmore is a member, issued this statement regarding the ruling.

As I shared in my message to our community last month, we remain committed to our mission of educating a diverse population of talented students who are eager to actively engage in the learning process. We also continue to be committed to attracting, admitting, and welcoming each entering class through a holistic process that helps to create a rewarding learning experience for students of many backgrounds and identities.

I am deeply concerned, as many of you may be, about the implications of this decision, not only for Skidmore, but for all higher education institutions across the country. We have put together a web page with resources about the issue, including FAQs that will be updated as additional information becomes available.

In the coming months, we will hold gatherings, forums, and other events and opportunities to reflect and discuss as a community as we forge a path forward together for an ever more inclusive Skidmore. For those of you who are on campus, a community check-in will be held today at Wyckoff Center at 3:30 p.m. All are welcome.

Our mission and our values, particularly our long-standing commitments to diversity and inclusivity throughout our community and our practices, will continue to guide and inspire our actions at Skidmore. We are a community that cares, and our fundamental principles remain unchanged.

Sincerely,

Marc Conner
President"
