"Supreme Court Ruling on Race-Conscious Admissions (AKA Affirmative Action): As many of you know, today’s ruling by the Supreme Court has decided that Harvard and UNC’s admissions programs violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

We are immensely disappointed by this ruling.

Though we do not agree with this decision, we have a legal obligation to comply. Within that context, Babson remains undeterred. We have been working tirelessly to ensure that our admissions processes remain holistic and reflective of our institutional values and will continue to uphold our unwavering commitment to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in our student body and across all communities. These strategic imperatives remain at the core of our mission, vision, and values.

As a global institution, Babson knows that all students benefit from a diverse student body. We have seen firsthand that learning in an environment among students who have different backgrounds and lived experiences fosters stronger critical thinking skills, empathy, and overall knowledge and understanding. Diverse perspectives and ideas are critical to innovation and at the forefront of our curriculum and our signature approach to Entrepreneurial Thought and Action®. Differing points of view and experiences also better prepare students to succeed in the multicultural society beyond their time at Babson College.

Our mission, to prepare and empower a diverse array of entrepreneurial leaders to create sustainable economic and social value everywhere, is one of our greatest strengths. We will continue to prioritize access, opportunity, and belonging for people from every background who are interested in learning and growing at Babson. We will continue to use a holistic admissions model that involves academic, nonacademic, and contextual considerations to evaluate the student as a whole person. And, we will proudly continue to invest in meaningful community engagement initiatives, such as the Inclusive Excellence Summit, our 11 Employee Resource Groups, and the 80 student-led conferences and events across campus that support diversity, equity, inclusivity, and belonging.

Our academic and administrative leadership teams are now conducting a detailed review of the Supreme Court ruling and evaluating its potential impacts on our institution. As we move forward, we will continue to engage and communicate with our community, ensuring that Babson remains a diverse, accessible, and inclusive institution for all.
