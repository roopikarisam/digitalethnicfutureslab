"Today, in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the admissions programs at Harvard and UNC violate the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because both programs “lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.” Importantly, the Court’s decision also emphasizes that “nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise…. A benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must be tied to that student’s courage and determination. Or a benefit to a student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that student’s unique ability to contribute to the university.” Today’s decision does not prevent us from doing what we have always done. We will continue to consider how each student’s background, strengths, and characteristics contribute to our intellectually stimulating, creative, and unique community. We will continue to admit talented and well-rounded students who think differently, demonstrate courage and resilience, have the enthusiasm to learn within our immersive Block Plan, and seek to collaborate with and learn from diverse communities. Today’s decision does not change who we are. We remain steadfast in our commitment to enrolling a diverse student body comprised of people from different backgrounds and lived experiences. Doing so strengthens our rich liberal arts education, guarantees a learning environment that prepares students for global engagement, fosters the courageous conversations and critical thinking necessary for a healthy democracy, ensures our graduates contribute to the creative solutions required to solve the world’s intractable challenges, and models for our students how to create a world that is more equitable and just."
