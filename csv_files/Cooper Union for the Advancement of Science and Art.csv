"Since 1859, The Cooper Union has been committed to opening its doors to students from every background. Our founder, Peter Cooper, held a vision of the institution where students would enroll without regard to race, gender, religion, or socioeconomic status. 
 
Now, more than 160 years later, this fundamental principle lives on. Cooper does not and will not discriminate against applicants based on race, gender, religion, or socioeconomic status. Nothing in our current admissions process provides favorable or unfavorable treatment based on these factors.
 
Half of Cooper’s student body has roots in the incredible melting pot that is New York City. The other half come to New York from all corners of the U.S. and from more than 25 countries. They represent a diversity of cultures, identities, backgrounds, and experiences. At Cooper, this kind of student community and environment is not only ideal training for the future of our students in an increasingly diverse and interconnected world, but it also enriches the student experience in immeasurable ways. 
 
Today’s Supreme Court decision will not alter The Cooper Union’s commitment to inclusion. We will continue to be driven in our admissions process by our founding values. We will continue to encourage students from all backgrounds to consider applying. We will continue to evaluate applicants on the entirety of their qualifications and life experiences. We will not alter our commitment to a holistic process that treats each applicant individually.
 
The Cooper Union remains an open and welcoming place for all.  
 
Mark Campbell
Vice President for Enrollment
The Cooper Union"
