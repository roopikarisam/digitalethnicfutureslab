"A truly great university is defined by breakthrough discovery, world-class scholarship and transformative personal growth and enrichment. Following the decision announced by the U.S. Supreme Court earlier today, we write to you to reaffirm the university’s commitment to diversity as an essential element of our commitment to excellence. Tulane must be an equitable, diverse and inclusive community that welcomes and supports a wide array of students, faculty and staff. The transformative value derived from a diverse university community enriches, energizes and informs our research, discovery and teaching in ways that benefit everyone. Over the last several years, we have made great strides in fostering an environment where each member of our academic community can thrive. And we have much more work to do together. We have been preparing for today’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling with this commitment in mind. Now that the decision has been announced, we will be reviewing changes we may need to make to ensure we are achieving our goals of diversity and inclusivity to the fullest extent permitted by law. A working group, which is comprised of a wide array of experts from across the university, has been meeting regularly. Their efforts will inform our practices to ensure we continue to attract the best and brightest students. We know the best research and learning occurs on a campus that reflects our multicultural world, which in turn has the most positive impact on improving our society. We will continue to welcome and support students, faculty and staff from the widest range of cultural and educational backgrounds."
