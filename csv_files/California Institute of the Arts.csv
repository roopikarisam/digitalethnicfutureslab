"Dear CalArtians,

The U.S. Supreme Court has issued decisions in two cases regarding affirmative action and the consideration of race as a factor in the college admissions process. The court determined that the use of race-conscious admissions as practiced by Harvard College and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is unconstitutional, a decision that will significantly curtail the ability of colleges and universities nationwide to consider race and ethnicity in admissions decisions.

As we process the implications of the ruling, it is important to note that CalArts has always engaged in a holistic, qualitative admission process that does not directly consider applicants’ race or ethnicity, but that does place extraordinary value on developing a community that welcomes and embraces a broad diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and identities. While the court’s decision has no effect on our admissions process, we must acknowledge the impact it will have across the landscape of higher education.   

We are just beginning to assess the potential impact of this decision, as well as this morning’s ruling striking down the Biden administration’s student loan forgiveness plan. We will share additional perspectives and resources with you in the coming days. In the meantime, we leave you with assurance that the CalArts community will remain steadfast in our commitment to equity in access to the highest standard of education for the arts.

In solidarity,

Michael Elgarico               
Vice President for Enrollment Management
